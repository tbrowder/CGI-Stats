The main problem with the original scheme
for stats collection was determining
the virtual host accurately. After
looking at the raw data collected, I
believe I should do the following:

0. create a list of mappings from
   SUB.DOM.TLDs of interest to column 
   names, e.g.,

     my %doms = %(
         nwflug.org => 'nwflug_org',
     );

1. check several envvar values to 
   determine the vhost:

     my $vhost = 0; 
     my $vcol  = 0;
     my $test-string = join @envvars-values;
     for %domlist.kv -> $k, $v {
         # protect the periods in the key
         if $test-string ~~ /:i '$k'/ {
             $vhost = $k;
             $vcol  = $v;
             last;
         }
     }
     exit if !$vhost;
     # handle logging...
