The main problem with the original scheme
for stats collection was determining
the virtual host accurately. After
looking at the raw data collected, I
believe I should do the following:

0. create a list of 
   SUB.DOM.TLDs of interest, e.g.,

     my %doms = set <
         nwflug\.org 
         psrr\.info
     );

1. check several envvar values to 
   determine the vhost:

     my $vhost = 0; 
     my $test-string = join @envvars-values;
     for %domlist.keys -> $k {
         # protect the periods in the key??
         if $test-string ~~ /:i $k/ {
             $vhost = $k;
             last;
         }
     }
     exit if !$vhost;
     # handle logging...
