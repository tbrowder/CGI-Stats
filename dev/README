We want to record the following data from our
virtual websites:

  the IP who visited (handle ipv4 and ipv6)
  time of visit (yyyyddmmThh)
  virtual host visited (canonical name)

  if a client tls cert was presented,
    record the email of the visitor

In order to do that we define the following
two tables:

    create table if not exists tls_stats (
        email text,
        vhost text,
        datehour int,
        unique (email, vhost, datehour)
    );

    create table if not exists ip_stats (
        ip int,     -- use Net::IP to convert to-from IP-uint
        ipversion int, -- 4 or 6
        vhost text,
        datehour int,
        unique (ip, ipversion, vhost, datehour)
    );

We need two CGI programs which can be used
for each virtual host:

  a program that runs at each access of
    a virtual host's index.shtml page
    and collects and stores the data

  a program that reports the data upon
    request by the visitor

For testing, we also need a separate, 
second program that collects stats in
another db.
