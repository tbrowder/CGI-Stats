Plan to switch to Perl 6 AND 
simplify web stats database
handling:

1. Rewrite funcs and modules in Perl 6.
   Define another name for the main db.
   Define a new format for the new db: see methods
   used for computertch email for
   application to this process

2. Put the new suite of tools in
   the main CGI bin dir.

3. Add the new tools to the existing
   html files.

4. After a period of testing, compare
   the databases. If they are the same,
   stop the web server, convert the old
   db to the new format, and replace 
   Perl 5 and the old db with Perl 6
   and the new db.
